We have also made efforts to improve productivity by selecting the language and technology to be used according to the requirements and deadline, and deploying them as microservices."},{"text":"I am willing to work on problem solving as an engineer who can quickly learn languages and technologies and deeply commit to the users in any environment."},{"text":"Please take a look at our \\"works\\" page to see what we have created with the permission of the company."}]},{"heading":"Special skill","texts":[{"text":"I specialize in finding problems and developing full-stack systems and applications that lead to solutions.
